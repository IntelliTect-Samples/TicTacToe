# Tic Tac Toe
Simple Tic Tac Toe Game that learns to play.

I have heard of companies giving a TicTacToe game as a project for potential applicants. As an interviewer I wanted to assess how well it demonstrated my knowledge and see how long it would take me do to a quick and dirty implementation.

##My Requirements:
1. A console app of standard Tic Tac Toe
2. .NET Core
3. Computer had to make smart moves
4. Computer needs to learn from mistakes
5. Computer should play itself to get smart

I would not consider this ideal code, just one way to implement. 

Note: I did this for fun and was more interested in the logic than the unit testing. I figure adding unit testing would have double the effort because unit testing the learning code would have been a big hassle and I didn't consider that fun. It would be great if someone else who really enjoys writing unit tests wanted to add that.
