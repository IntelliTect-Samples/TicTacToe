# Tic Tac Toe
Simple Tic Tac Toe Game that learns to play.

I have heard of companies giving a Tic Tac Toe game as a project for potential applicants. As an interviewer I wanted to assess how well it demonstrated my knowledge and see how long it would take me do to a quick and dirty implementation.

##My Requirements:
1. A console app of standard Tic Tac Toe
2. .NET Core
3. Computer had to make smart moves
4. Computer needs to learn from mistakes
5. Computer should play itself to get smart

##I wanted to answer a couple of questions:
1. Is this a reasonable assignement just in terms of effort required?
2. What does this assess?

###Reasonableness
It took me 2.5 hours to complete the code to the intial check in. That seems decent since most of the examples I have seen don't implement any type of learning which was by far the most time consuming part, probably 2 hours. However, most applicants would probably do something more than a console app which would probably add another couple of hours to make it pretty. Also doing unit testing would also add a couple of hours. So, this is about an 8 hour project to do 'right'

###Skill Assessment
This did force me to do several things:

1. General coding abilities and style
2. Creating classes and seperation of responsibilities
3. Patterns for learnging algorithms
4. Basic User Experience understanding
5. Looping and logic structures
6. Storing and looking up data

Perfect, no. Decent, yes.

I would not consider this ideal code, just one way to implement. There was little to no rework of the initial check in.

Note: I did this for fun and was more interested in the logic than the unit testing. I figure adding unit testing would have double the effort because unit testing the learning code would have been a big hassle and I didn't consider that fun. It would be great if someone else who really enjoys writing unit tests wanted to add that.
